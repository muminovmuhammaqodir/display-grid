							wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
							and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
							never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
							project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
							learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
							ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during
							interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
							certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
							after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
